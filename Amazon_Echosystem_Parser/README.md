Parse the databases from an Amazon Alexa image.

If new SQLite databases have been identified or schemas have been changed then you can update the SQL queries that access them.

To update the queries open the Alexa_DB.db3 database in your favorite SQLite browser and update what you need to.

The file Alexa_Creates.SQL are examples of insert statements into the ALexa_DB.db3 database.

If you find things are added or changed please let me know and I can add them in or you can create a PR for it.
